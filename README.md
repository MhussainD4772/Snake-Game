# 🐍 Snake Game – Python Tkinter Edition 🎮🔥

A modern, polished version of the classic Snake Game built using Python and Tkinter.

---

## **📌 Overview**
This **Snake Game** is a fully interactive and animated version of the classic game.  
It features **smooth movement, collision detection, a pixel-style background grid, a fading Game Over animation, and a glowing food effect!**  

---

## **🎨 Features**
✅ **Smooth Movement** – The snake moves fluidly without delays.  
✅ **Collision Detection** – The snake dies if it hits the walls or itself.  
✅ **Growing Snake** – The snake grows longer every time it eats food.  
✅ **Glowing Food Effect** – Food glows with a yellow outline for visibility.  
✅ **Retro Grid Background** – Adds a cool pixel-style effect.  
✅ **Fading "Game Over" Animation** – Red and black flashing text when the game ends.  
✅ **Clean Code** – Structured with separate files for logic (`main.py`, `snake.py`, `food.py`).
