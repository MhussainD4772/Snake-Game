*A modern, polished version of the classic Snake Game built using Python and Tkinter!* 🚀

## **📌 Overview**
This **Snake Game** is a **fully interactive** and **animated** version of the classic snake game. It features **smooth movement, a pixel-style background grid, a fading Game Over animation, and a glowing food effect!**  

---

## **🎨 Features**
✅ **Smooth Movement** – The snake moves fluidly without delays.  
✅ **Collision Detection** – The snake dies if it hits the walls or itself.  
✅ **Growing Snake** – The snake grows longer every time it eats food.  
✅ **Glowing Food Effect** – Food glows with a yellow outline for visibility.  
✅ **Retro Grid Background** – Adds a cool pixel-style effect.  
✅ **Fading "Game Over" Animation** – Red and black flashing text when the game ends.  
✅ **Clean Code** – Structured with separate files for logic (`main.py`, `snake.py`, `food.py`).
